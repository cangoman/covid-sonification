					Composition is created from two data points producing the sound: daily
					cases and daily deaths. Each country is mapped to a note and makes a
					sound based on the dayâ€™s reported cases and deaths.

					The volume of each note is determined by the number of new cases and
					the number of daily deaths are mapped to a delay effect on each
					synthesizer - higher number of deaths result in a more rapid and
					audible echo.
